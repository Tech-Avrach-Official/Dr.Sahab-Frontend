"Losing a tooth can affect more than just your appearance; it can impact your ability to eat, speak, and your overall jaw health. At Dr. Sahab Clinic, Indore, we offer the gold standard in tooth replacement: Dental Implants. Unlike dentures or bridges, an implant acts as a prosthetic root made of medical-grade titanium that integrates directly with your jawbone. This provides an incredibly stable foundation for a custom-crafted porcelain crown that looks, feels, and functions exactly like a natural tooth.",

"Our implant procedure is driven by precision. Using advanced 3D imaging, Dr. Sahab plans the exact placement to ensure maximum comfort and longevity. This treatment not only fills the gap in your smile but also prevents the bone loss that naturally occurs when a tooth is missing. Whether you need to replace a single tooth or require a full-mouth restoration, our team provides a sterile, state-of-the-art environment right here in Indore to help you regain your bite and your confidence."

At Dr. Sahab Clinic, Indore, we offer high-quality Crowns and Bridges designed to protect your oral health and return your smile to its natural beauty.",

"A Dental Crown (often called a cap) is a custom-fitted restoration that covers the entire visible portion of a damaged tooth. It acts as a protective shield, restoring the tooth's shape, size, and strength. For those missing one or more consecutive teeth, a Dental Bridge serves as a permanent solution, bridging the gap by anchoring a prosthetic tooth to the healthy teeth on either side.",

"We use premium materials such as Zirconia and E-Max Porcelain, known for their incredible durability and light-reflecting properties that mimic natural enamel. Each restoration is precision-crafted to match the shade and contour of your existing teeth. Whether you need to strengthen a tooth after a Root Canal or want to fill a gap that has been bothering you for years, Dr. Sahab ensures a fit so perfect you’ll forget it’s not a natural tooth."

When the inner pulp of your tooth—containing nerves and blood vessels—becomes infected due to deep decay or injury, a Root Canal is the only way to save the tooth from extraction.",

"The process involves carefully removing the infected tissue, cleaning and disinfecting the inner canals, and sealing them with a biocompatible material to prevent future infection.",

"Under the expert care of Dr. Sahab, we utilize Rotary Endodontics and high-precision imaging to ensure the treatment is fast, efficient, and virtually painless. By choosing RCT, you preserve your natural jaw structure, maintain your natural bite, and most importantly, get immediate relief from the throbbing pain caused by dental infection. Once the tooth is sealed and protected with a custom crown, it can function perfectly for a lifetime."

"Daily brushing is essential, but it isn’t always enough to reach every corner of your mouth. Over time, plaque—a sticky film of bacteria—hardens into calculus (tartar), which cannot be removed by a regular toothbrush. At Dr. Sahab Clinic, Indore, our professional scaling and polishing treatment is designed to deep-clean your teeth and gums, preventing the onset of cavities and gum disease.",

"Using advanced ultrasonic scalers, we gently vibrate away stubborn tartar and surface stains caused by tea, coffee, or food colors. This is followed by prophylaxis polishing, where we use a specialized paste to smooth the tooth surfaces. This not only gives your teeth a bright, glassy finish but also makes it harder for new plaque to stick. A session at Dr. Sahab Clinic leaves your mouth feeling incredibly fresh, eliminates bad breath (halitosis), and ensures your gums stay healthy and firm."

This can lead to intense pain, swelling, and damage to neighboring healthy teeth. At Dr. Sahab Clinic, we specialize in the safe and gentle extraction of wisdom teeth, using advanced local anesthesia and surgical techniques to ensure a comfortable experience.",


"Dr. Sahab utilizes high-definition digital X-rays to map the exact position of the tooth and its proximity to nerves before the procedure.

We don’t just remove the tooth; we provide a comprehensive recovery plan to get you back to your normal Indore routine as quickly as possible.
